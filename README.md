[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/metagem.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/metagem)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/platanus/metagem.svg?style=shield)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/platanus/metagem)

Metagem generates the structure and configuration necessary to have plugins (gems and engines) inside your Rails project.

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "metagem"
```

```bash
bundle install
```

Then, run the installer:

```bash
rails generate metagem:install
```

## Usage

TODO

## Development

### Models and migrations

- Create dummy app models with development and testing purposes inside the dummy app `spec/dummy`:

  `bin/rails g model user`

  The `User` model will be created in `spec/dummy/app/models`.
  The `user_spec.rb` file needs to be deleted, but it is a good idea to leave the factory.

- Create engine related models inside the engine's root path '/':

  `bin/rails g model job`

  The `EngineName::Job` model will be created in `app/models/engine_name`.
  A factory will be added to `engine_name/spec/factories/engine_name/jobs.rb`, you must to add the `class` option manually.

  ```ruby
  FactoryBot.define do
    factory :job, class: "EngineName::Job" do
      # ...
    end
  end
  ```

- While developing the engine run migrations in the root path `bin/rails db:migrate`. This will apply the gem and dummy app migrations too.
- When using in a project, the engine migrations must be copied to it. This can be done by running: `bin/rails engine_name:install:migrations`

## Testing

To run the specs you need to execute, in the root path of the engine, the following command:

```bash
bundle exec guard
```

You need to put **all your tests** in the `/metagem/spec` directory.
